# Sparsemm
GPGPU project in C using OpenACC, for an algorithm to perform sparse matrix multiplication.

Read the report to find out more.
I have a new version using OpenMP and a slightly different algorithm, but I haven't been able to finish it as Durham's super computer is currently down. I will upload in the near future.
